\begin_layout Abstract
Precision measurements of the large scale structure of the Universe require
 large numbers of high fidelity mock catalogs to accurately assess, and
 account for, the presence of systematic effects.
 We introduce and test a scheme for generating mock catalogs rapidly using
 suitably derated N-body simulations.
 Our aim is to reproduce the large scale structure and the gross properties
 of dark matter halos with high accuracy, while sacrificing the details
 of the halo's internal structure.
 By adjusting global and local time-steps in an N-body code, we demonstrate
 recovery of the relevant large scale probes, including individual halo
 masses, to better than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\%$
\end_inset

 and the power spectrum to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

, to better than 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

, while requiring a factor of 4 less CPU time.
 To reduce the number of output snapshots, we also test the redshift spacing
 of outputs required to generate simulated light cones.
 We find that outputs separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta0.05$
\end_inset

 allow us to interpolate particle positions and velocities with sufficient
 accuracy to reproduce the real and redshift space power spectra to better
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 (out to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

).
 Even with a redshift spacing as large as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.25$
\end_inset

, these errors only degrade to less than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\%$
\end_inset

 in both real and redshift space.
 As a practical demonstration of these ideas, we generate a suit of simulations
 matched to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large-volume spectroscopic surveys of the Universe (
\color red
CITE SDSS, WiggleZ, BOSS
\color inherit
) are revolutionizing our understanding of cosmology and structure formation.
 Based on these successes, a new generation of surveys (
\color red
CITE DESI, Euclid, WFIRST
\color inherit
) is being planned that will improve our constraints by an order of magnitude
 (or more).
 This unprecedented improvement in statistical precision places stringent
 demands on the theoretical modeling and analysis techniques; simulations
 will play an essential in meeting these requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the challenges for simulations are the varied roles they play, and
 the different requirements these impose on the simulations.
 At one extreme, simulations are necessary for generating sample covariances
 for the data and measurements.
 This typically requires very large volumes to simulate entire surveys thousands
 of times, but have lower accuracy requirements.
 Motivated by these considerations, a number of recent studies have investigated
 methods designed to produce mock catalogs with reduced accuracy, but much
 higher throughput compared to the full N-body simulations

.
 An open question still is the effect of changing the input cosmology used
 to generate the covariance matrix on cosmological inferences, and how best
 to implement such variations.
 More recently, the impact of super-survey modes (modes outside the survey
 volume) on inferred errors has been shown to be potentially larger than
 previously appreciated 
\color red
(CITES??)
\color inherit
 and is an area of active study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the other extreme, simulations are crucial for calibrating the theoretical
 models used to fit the data.
 Examples here are quantifying shifts in the baryon acoustic oscillation
 distance scale due to nonlinear evolution and galaxy bias (
\color red
CITES
\color inherit
), or templates used to fit the full shape of the correlation function.
 For such applications, one ideally requires high fidelity simulations.
 The volume requirements are significantly reduced from that for covariance
 matrices, but still need to much larger than survey volumes to keep systematic
 errors below statistical errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An intermediate application are the generation of mock catalogs that capture
 the observational characteristics of surveys (eg.
 geometry, selection effects).
 The importance of these cannot be underestimated, since the effects of
 many observational systematics can only be quantitatively estimated by
 simulating them.
 These issues will get progressively more important for the next generations
 of surveys which will move away from highly complete and pure samples that
 have mostly been used for cosmological studies to date.

The simplest way to generate approximate density fields is to use analytic
 approximations such as Lagrangian perturbation theory followed by prescriptions
 to put in halos in a way that better matches results from N-body simulations

\end_inset

.
 These methods are successful in capturing the large-scale density field
 but lose information at small scales.
 Because of their speed, they can be used to produce large numbers of simulation
s required to build sample covariance matrices, at error levels ranging
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $5-10\%$
\end_inset

 (depending on the quantities being predicted).
 It is difficult to estimate, however, what the loss of accuracy implies
 for tests of systematic errors, which may need to be modeled at the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1\%$
\end_inset

 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach we take here is to reduce the small-scale accuracy of a high-resolu
tion N-body code by coarsening its temporal resolution.
 In the present case, the time-stepping consists of two components, (i)
 a long time step for solving for evolution under the long-range particle-mesh
 (PM) force, and (ii) a set of underlying sub-cycled time steps for a short-rang
e particle-particle interaction, computed either via a tree-based algorithm,
 or by direct particle-particle force evaluations.
 The idea is to reduce the number of both types of time steps while preserving
 enough accuracy to correctly describe the large scale distribution of galaxies,
 as modeled by a halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach.
 Our first goal in this paper is, therefore, to quantitatively understand
 the impact of the temporal resolution on the halo density field and how
 best to accurately reproduce the details of the halo density field on large
 scales, sacrificing small scale structure information.
 This allows to generate a suite of large volume simulations, spanning a
 range of cosmologies.
 This paper presents the details of these simulations and outlines future
 applications.

The HACC framework arose from the early realization that development of
 a future large-scale computational framework must be fully cognizant of
 coming changes in computational architectures.
 It is descended from an approach developed for the heterogeneous architecture
 of Roadrunner

, the first computer to break the petaflop barrier.
 HACC is designed with great flexibility in mind (combining MPI with a variety
 of more local programming models, e.g., OpenCL, OpenMP) and is easily adaptable
 to different platforms.
 Currently, it is implemented on Cell-accelerated hardware, conventional
 and GPU-enhanced clusters (via OpenCL), on the IBM Blue Gene architecture
 (using OpenMP), and is running on prototype Intel MIC/Xeon Phi hardware.
 HACC is the first, and currently the only large-scale cosmology code suite
 world-wide, that can run at scale (and beyond) on all available supercomputer
 architectures.

HACC uses a hybrid parallel algorithmic structure, splitting the force calculati
on into a specially designed grid-based long/medium range spectral particle-mesh
 (PM) component that is common to all architectures, and an architecture-specifi
c short-range solver.
 Modular code design combined with particle caching allows the short-range
 solvers to be `hot-swappable' on-node; they are blind to the parallel implement
ation of the long-range solver.
 The short-range solvers can use direct particle-particle interactions,
 i.e., a P

 Cray XE6 systems (TreePM algorithm).
 The availability of multiple algorithms within the HACC framework allows
 us to carry out careful error analyses, for example, the P

\begin_layout Standard
The HACC philosophy is that, as a general rule, both particle and grid methods
 are difficult to implement as global solutions: For physics and implementation
 reasons, grid-based techniques are better suited to larger length scales,
 with particle methods having the opposite property.
 This suggests that the higher `top' levels of code organization should
 be grid-based, interacting with particle information at a lower level of
 the computational hierarchy.
 The design ideas underlying HACC give us a very important head start in
 tackling the challenges posed by future architectures.

\noindent
On heterogeneous systems such as Roadrunner, or Titan at Oak Ridge, HACC
 has the following layout: At the top level, the medium/long range force
 is handled by a special low-noise, high accuracy, FFT-based method that
 operates at the CPU layer.
 Depending on the memory balance between the CPU and the accelerator (Cell
 or GPU), we can choose to specify two different modes, (i) grids held on
 the CPU and particles on the accelerator, or (ii) a streaming paradigm
 with grid and particle information primarily resident in CPU memory with
 computations streamed through the accelerator.
 In both cases, the local force solve is a direct particle-particle interaction,
 i.e., the whole is a P

M code

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 with hardware acceleration, albeit an unconventional implementation based
 on high-order spectral methods.
 The acceleration leads to a speed-up of 50-100 times over conventional
 processors.
 For a many-core system, the top layer of the code remains the same, but
 the short-range solver changes to a tree-based algorithm which is much
 better suited to the Blue Gene and Intel MIC architectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our strategy simultaneously overcomes two problems: (i) how to switch short-rang
e solvers easily, and (ii) overcome the communication bottleneck between
 the CPU and accelerator layers, or the analog for a many-core system (on-node
 vs.
 off-node communication).
 We drastically reduce the particle communication by using a mirrored particle
 cache, termed `particle overloading', implemented on top of our 3-D domain
 decomposition (see Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "overload"

\end_inset

).
 The point of overloading -- loosely analogous to ghost regions in mesh-based
 codes -- is to allow exact medium/long-range force calculations with no
 communication of particle information and high-accuracy local force calculation
s with relatively sparse refreshes of the overloading zone (for details,
 see Ref.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mc3"

\end_inset

).
 The second advantage of overloading is that it frees the local force solver
 from handling communication tasks, which are taken care of by the long/medium-r
ange force framework.
 Thus new `on-node' local methods can be plugged in with no extra work and
 guaranteed scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conventional particle-mesh codes use a mixture of spatial filtering/differencing
 and spectral techniques; the resulting complicated communication templates
 can be problematic, particularly at the accelerator or many-core processor
 level.
 To combat this, HACC uses digital filtering and differencing in the spectral
 domain, allowing a simple spatial deposition technique, Cloud-In-Cell (CIC)
 to be used.
 Combined with particle overloading, this can reduce all communication to
 a negligible overhead, except that in the parallel FFT, which lives only
 at the top level.
 A new 2-D domain decomposed (pencils instead of slabs) FFT has been implemented
 to guarantee good scaling properties.
 The code design leads to ideal scaling properties of HACC up to very large
 number of processors, with exascale requirements already designed in to
 the algorithms.
 Full-machine scaling has been demonstrated on Roadrunner's Open Science
 phase, when MC
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

 (the HACC precursor) was the only code to run across the full machine,
 on Mira and Sequoia (Cf.
 Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), and on Titan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HACC has been ported to all the DOE Leadership class platforms; the choice
 of the local force algorithm strongly depends on the architecture; for
 an accelerated system (local) 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 methods are favorable since `compute is free' but complicated data structures
 are to be avoided, while for CPU-based systems, tree algorithms are a superior
 choice.
 HACC currently supports three production variants: (i) the Cell-accelerated
 P
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

M code on Cerrillos (a smaller, open version of Roadrunner); (ii) a GPU-accelera
ted P
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

M version with an OpenCL implementation on OLCF's Titan; (iii) a TreePM
 version for many-core machines, e.g., ANL's Blue Gene/Q, Mira and NERSC's
 Hopper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important feature of the work proposed here is the ability to carry out
 error-controlled approximate simulations at high throughput.
 In order to understand how we implement this, some details of the HACC
 time-stepping algorithm are now provided.
 HACC uses a symplectic scheme with sub-cycling of the short-range force.
 The basic idea is not to finite-difference the equations of motion, but
 to view evolution as a symplectic map on phase space, written in the exponentia
ted form familiar from Lie methods: 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(t)=\exp(-t{\bf {H}})\zeta(0)$
\end_inset

 where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 is a phase-space vector 
\begin_inset Formula $({\bf x},{\bf v})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the Hamiltonian, and the operator, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf {H}}=[H,~]_{P}$
\end_inset

, denotes the action of taking the Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian.
 Suppose that the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of two parts; then
 by using the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff (CBH) theorem we can build an integrator
 for the time evolution due to that Hamiltonian.
 Repeated application of the CBH formula can be used to show that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp(-t({\bf {H}}_{1}+{\bf {H}}_{2}))=\exp(-(t/2){\bf {H}}_{1})\exp(-t{\bf {H}}_{2})\exp(-(t/2){\bf {H}}_{1})+O(t^{3})
\]

\end_inset

is a second order symplectic integrator.
 In the basic PM application, the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the free particle (kinetic) piece while 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the one-particle effective potential; corresponding respectively to
 the `stream' and `kick' maps 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}=\exp(-t{\bf {H}}_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}=\exp(-t{\bf {H}}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 In the stream map, the particle position is drifted using its known velocity,
 which remains unchanged; in the kick map, the velocity is updated using
 the force evaluation, while the position remains unchanged.
 This symmetric `split-operator' step is termed SKS (stream-kick-stream).
 A KSK scheme constitutes an alternative second-order symplectic integrator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of both short and long-range forces, we split the Hamiltonian
 into two parts, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}=H_{sr}+H_{lr}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{sr}$
\end_inset

 contains the kinetic and particle-particle force interaction (with an associate
d map 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{sr}$
\end_inset

), whereas, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}=H_{lr}$
\end_inset

 is just the long range force, corresponding to the map 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{lr}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the long range force varies relatively slowly, we construct a single
 time-step map by subcycling 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{sr}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{full}(t)=M_{lr}(t/2)(M_{sr}(t/n_{c}))^{n_{c}}M_{lr}(t/2),$
\end_inset

 the total map being a usual second-order symplectic integrator.
 This corresponds to a KSK step, where the S is not an exact stream step,
 but has enough 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{sr}$
\end_inset

 steps composed together to obtain the required accuracy.
 (We take care that the time-dependence in the self-consistent potential
 is treated correctly.) As discussed later below, we will use the flexibility
 in the sub-cycling as a way of reducing the number of time steps such that
 the loss of accuracy only affects the resolution at very small scales,
 which are not of interest in the current set of simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Time Step Tuning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we systematically examine how reducing the number of time
 steps affects individual halo properties (i.e., halo masses, positions, and
 velocities), as well as aggregate statistics like the mass function and
 spatial clustering.
 We run a set of convergence tests with boxes of size 
\begin_inset Formula $(256h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $256^{3}$
\end_inset

 particles.
 These runs have the same particle mass as the main 
\begin_inset Formula $(4000h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 volume simulations.
 We run these with the following time step options : 450/5, 300/3, 300/2,
 150/3 and 150/2 where the first number is the number of long time-steps,
 while the second is the number of subcycles.
 The 450/5 case has been independently verified to give fully converged
 results and is the baseline against which we compare all other results.
 Each simulation is started from the same initial conditions and evolved
 down to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

.
 We demonstrate that the 300/2 case, corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta a\approx0.003$
\end_inset

 reproduces the full resolution simulation for all the large scale properties
 we consider, and is our choice for the mocks presented in Sec.

\begin_layout Subsection
Matching 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compare detailed halo properties we need to match individual
 halos across different runs (reference vs.
 run under test).
 We first discuss the algorithm used for identifying the corresponding halos
 in the two cases and then compare halo mass, position, and velocity for
 the matched halos.
 From this quantitative comparison, we find that the simulations with 300
 global time steps have significantly less scatter in the measured quantities,
 compared to the baseline determined by the 450/5 simulation, than do the
 samples with 150 global steps.
 In addition, we find that the differences between the different sub-cycling
 choices are almost negligible.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All simulations share the same particle initial conditions, allowing us
 to match halos in different runs by matching their individual particle
 content.
 Given a halo in simulation A, we consider all halos in simulation B that
 between them hold all the particles belonging to the halo in simulation
 A.
 Given this list of possible matches, we choose the run B halo with the
 largest number of common particles with the reference halo in run A.
 To avoid spurious matches, we also require that the fraction of common
 particles (relative to simulation A) exceeds a given threshold.
 To illustrate how this matching algorithm works, we use the samples from
 the 300/2 simulation and the 450/5 simulation, and adopt a threshold of
 50% as our default choice.
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:mass-content"

\end_inset

 demonstrates that the unmatched fraction increases with increasing threshold
 and decreasing halo mass.)

The matching algorithm described above is unidirectional, hence multiple
 halos in run A may have particles resident in a single halo in run B; in
 our simulations, this happens at the 1-2% level, adopting a particle matching
 threshold of 50%.
 We refer to these cases as `multiply-booked' halos.

 arises when
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
As the top left panel shows, there are low-mass halos in the 450/5 simulation
 corresponding to high-mass halos in the 300/2 simulation.
 The same trend is observed for the case of multiply-booked halos (bottom
 left panel), but not for the non-multiply-booked halos (top right).
 Furthermore, the disagreement for halo masses between the two simulations
 are resolved by adding the corresponding halo masses.
 This implies that there are multiple halos in the 450/5 simulation which
 are merged into one halo in the 300/2 simulation.
 The smaller number of time steps in the 300/2 simulations reduces substructure
 as well as the compactness of the halos compared to the 450/5 simulation.
 Thus, for a small fraction of halos in the 450/5 simulation, individual
 halos can be merged into a single halo in the 300/2 simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the number densities of the unmatched halos in the 450/5 simulation
 when compared to the 300/2 simulation at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

.
 There are three reasons that halos can turn up as unmatched.
 In the first case, particles forming a halo in simulation A may not form
 a component of a halo in simulation B (no common particles).
 Second, if the fraction of common particles over the total number of particles
 in each halo is less than the threshold of 50%, these halos will be eliminated
 from the matching set.
 Finally, for the case of multiply-booked halos, we remove all but the one
 with the largest number of common particles.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mass-content"

\end_inset

, we show each type of unmatched number density as a function of halo mass.
 The first case occurs only for low halo masses, where low effective resolution
 in a simulation can lead to halo drop out (halos are too 'fuzzy' to meet
 the Friends-of-Friends (FOF) overdensity criterion), and falls off steeply
 with rising halo mass.
 Most of the unmatched halos arise due to their not passing the threshold
 criterion.
 The loss of matching due to multiple-booking follows the trend of the below-thr
eshold case, but at a reduced level.
 We have checked that the trends discussed here are not affected by redshift.

Halo Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now systematically compare halo properties (i.e., halo mass, position,
 and velocity) for halos in the lower resolution runs that were successfully
 matched to those in the 450/5 simulation.
 We are interested in correctly describing the large-scale distribution
 of galaxies using an HOD approach; this requires that only the dark matter
 halo locations and masses be estimated sufficiently accurately.

 schemes.
 Figure

 steps have systematically lower FOF masses than those in the 450/5 simulation.
 (The same linking length (
\begin_inset Formula $b=0.168$
\end_inset

) is used in the FOF algorithm to define halos for all the simulations.)
 Under these circumstances, the FOF mass is highest in the 450/5 simulation,
 decreasing systematically with increase in loss of temporal resolution.

 almost the same number of halos as in the 450/5 simulation.
 Furthermore, Figure

 shows that the halo masses in the 450/5 and 300/2 simulations have linear
 relation with the slope being one.
 So, most of halos in the 300/2 simulation have the same mass as the ones
 in the 450/5 simulation.
 Since the number of sub-cycles do not affect to halo positions and velocities
 as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 bias can be easily corrected as described below), and sufficiently small

 This time-stepping option is therefore a good candidate for generating
 mock catalogs efficiently, while maintaining high accuracies.
 In terms of the time savings alone, this will result in an increased capacity
 to generate high quality catalogs by a factor of four, which is quite significa

Halo Mass Adjustment and Resulting Observables

\begin_layout Standard
Halos generated by the de-tuned simulations have systematically lower masses
 than the halos in the 450/5 simulation as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HaloProperty_mass"

\end_inset

.
 In the following, we describe how to implement a systematic mass correction
 by matching to the 450/5 results; we also display the resulting observables
 including mass functions and power spectra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To undertake the mass calibration, we first take all the matched halos between
 the 450/5 simulation and the de-tuned simulations and compute means for
 each mass bin.
 We consider only the matched halos because the aim of the mass adjustment
 is to correct systematic mass differences for the halos that are theoretically
 identical in the different runs.
 After computing the means for each mass bin, we fit them to a functional
 form that brings the reassigned halo mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{re}$
\end_inset

, close to the average halo mass for the 450/5 simulation.
 For our simulations, we find that the following simple form suffices for
 this task:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{re}=M(1.0+\alpha(M/10^{12.0}[{\rm M_{\odot}])^{\beta},}\label{eq:mass_adjust}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{re}$
\end_inset

 is the reassigned halo mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the original halo mass, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are free parameters.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values for the simulations with different numbers of time steps are listed
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The best-fit parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are functions of redshift.
 For the case of the 300/2 simulation, the best fit parameters are 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(z)=0.123z+0.052$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(z)=-0.154z-0.447$

 the original result differed by more than 10% (on all mass scales).

We next compute the halo-matter cross power spectra between halo and matter
 density fields in both real and redshift space, as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 This figure shows the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm}/P_{hm,450/5}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm,450/5}$
\end_inset

 is the cross power spectrum for the 450/5 simulation and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm}$
\end_inset

 is the cross power spectrum for other time steps.
 For the dark matter density field, we use the output of the 450/5 simulation
 for all the halo samples.
 Note that the dark matter density fields are in real-space for both cases.
 In this way, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm}/P_{hm,450/5}$
\end_inset

 in real-space is equivalent to the ratio of halo bias between the 450/5
 simulation and the simulations with other time-steps.
 To select halos, we apply the soft-mass cut method using the probability
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle N_{halo}(M)\rangle=\frac{1}{2}{\rm erfc}\left(\frac{{\rm log(M_{cut}/}M)}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we set 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm M_{cut}=10^{13.0}[{\rm M_{\odot}]}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 This probability has a similar form to the HOD technique so that the probabilit
y gradually becomes one as halo mass increases.
 We use this method to avoid noise from halos scattering across sharp halo
 mass boundaries.
 The errors calculated here are not due to sample variance as we generate
 10 samples from one full sample with the soft-mass cut method.
 The results show that as the time stepping is coarsened, the ratio of the
 cross power spectra increases, especially in redshift-space, where we observe
 large deviations from unity on small scales for the 150/2 and 150/3 simulations.
 This is due to the overall smaller halo velocities for those simulations,
 as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HaloProperty_step"

\end_inset

.
 For the simulations with the 300 global time steps, overall agreement with
 the 450/5 simulation is almost at the 1% level on any scale in both real-space
 and redshift-space.
 Based on these convergence tests, we conclude that the 300/2 option meets
 the error requirements.

\begin_layout Section
Constructing Light Cones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the simulations are run at the chosen time-stepping settings, the next
 step is to construct light-cone outputs.
 Here, we build light cones from snapshots whose redshift range is from
 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.8$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

, with a constant redshift separation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.1$
\end_inset

.
 The light cone is constructed using spherical shells, each shell is centered
 at the redshift of each snapshot, and has a redshift width of 0.1.
 In each shell, we displace the halo positions by using their peculiar velocitie
s in order to shift to light cone positions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}|_{z=z_{pos}}=\vec{x}|_{z=z_{snap}}+\vec{v}_{pec}|_{z=z_{snap}}\Delta t,\label{eq:lightcone}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{snap}$
\end_inset

 is the redshift of the snapshot, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{pos}$
\end_inset

 is the redshift corresponding to its radial position, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{pec}$
\end_inset

 is its peculiar velocity, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is the time elapsed between 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{snap}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{pos}$
\end_inset

.
 For the case of a halo crossing its boundary of the shell, we choose the
 halo whose distance from the boundary is closer before shifting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate how shifting affects a spatial distribution of halos, we compare
 the distances for the halos at different redshift before and after shifting
 their positions.
 For the comparison, we use the halos which exist at both redshifts by matching
 halo particle profiles, which is the same method described in Section 3.1.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $z=0.25$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

 before and after shifting.
 After shifting halos, we see that the mean distance between corresponding
 halos decreases from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.4h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $0.2h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 This result holds at all redshifts examined.

 brings down the halo bias to the one at

Testing the shift of the BAO peaks

We investigate how the peak of the  baryon acoustic oscillations (hereafter,
 BAO) shifts by varying the HOD parameters described in Ref.

.
 We do this in order to demonstrate how we can use the HACC simulations
 to test various cosmological measurements.
 We first split each 
\begin_inset Formula $(4h^{-1}{\rm Gpc)^{3}}$
\end_inset

 full box into 64 cubical subboxes, whose volume is 
\begin_inset Formula $(1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 each.
 Since we have four full boxes, we have 256 subboxes in total.
 We increase the number of samples to compute a covariance matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the HOD parameters, we use the same HOD parameters described in Section
 5.1 except 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{cut}$
\end_inset

.
 We vary 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{cut}$
\end_inset

 from 12.5 to 13.5 for every 0.2.
 Then, we compute correlation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{{\rm HOD}}(r)$
\end_inset

 for each of 256 samples and use 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 analysis to fit each correlation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{{\rm HOD}}(r)$
\end_inset

 to the template correlation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{m}(r)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{{\rm HOD}}(r)=B\xi_{m}(\alpha r)+A_{0}+A_{1}/r+A_{2}/r^{2},\label{eq:model1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $B$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$

 measures the shift of the BAO peak from its original position predicted
 by the linear perturbation theory.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$
\end_inset

 implies that there is no shift of the BAO peak.

\end_inset

 is a nonlinear parameter which accounts for broadening the BAO peak due
 to non-linear evolution.
 We set 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=7h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

.
 Since all parameters are linear except 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, we find the best-fit values for those parameters analytically and only
 need to vary 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 to find the minimum

 function described in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model1"

\end_inset

 with the best-fit parameters.
 Since the covariance matrix uses the 
\begin_inset Formula $(1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 subboxes, we divide the covariance matrix by 64 for the full correlation
 function.
 This is because the number of modes for the full boxes is increased by
 64 comparing to that of the subbox.
 We fit the correlation functions in the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[60h^{-1}{\rm Mpc},160h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}]$

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precision required for current and future galaxy spectroscopic surveys to
 test the expansion and structure formation histories of the Universe requires
 an accurate understanding of systematic effects.
 In this paper we have presented a quantitative study of the impact of time
 step sizes on the halo and matter density fields.
 Our code has two adjustable time stepping parameters - a global time step
 and a number of sub-cycles (responsible for a particle-particle interactions)
 to track that particle trajectories on small scales.
 We consider cases where we increase the length of each time step by factors
 of 1.5 and 3 respectively, as well as reducing the number of sub-cycles.
 Our fiducial choice is to use using 300 global time steps corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta a(z)=0.003$
\end_inset

 and 2 sub-cycles (increasing the length of the global time step by a factor
 of 1.5 and that of the sub-cycles by a factor of 2.5), resulting in a reduction
 of the simulation run time by 4 times less.
 We keep the mass resolution constant; the results here are based on a particle
 mass of 
\begin_inset Formula $6.86\times10^{10}h{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.We summarize the key results below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(a) The halo masses tend to be underestimated in these cases, as one might
 expect because reducing the number of time steps produces halos with less
 substructure and a more diffuse distribution of mass.
 However, this trend may be calibrated with smaller simulations and corrected,
 recovering the halo masses to 98%.
 The halo mass function is correctly recovered fully for masses above 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{12.7}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 100 particles.
 Note that we run the halo finder with identical parameters as in the full
 resolution runs.
 It may however be possible to get similar results by changing the parameters
 of the halo finder, as was done in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2013MNRAS.428.1036M"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(b) 
\color black
The halo positions and velocities are recovered with a scatter of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.08[h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $12.8[{\rm km/s}]$
\end_inset

 respectively for the simulation of our fiducial choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(c) The clustering of these halos is correctly recovered to better than
 1% on scales below 
\begin_inset Formula $k<1[h{\rm Mpc^{-1}]}$
\end_inset

 in real-space and 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.5[h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(d) We find that the number of sub-cycles makes almost no difference to
 any of our final results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
We also consider the redshift sampling required to construct light cone
 outputs.
 We first compare the distances for the halos at different redshifts before
 and after shifting their positions from one redshift to the another.
 Moving halos over a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.1$
\end_inset

 interval correctly reduces the standard deviation of those distances from
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25[h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}]$
\end_inset

 to
\color red
 
\color black

\begin_inset Formula $0.09[h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}]$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the power spectra are correctly recovered to better than 1% for
 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.5[h{\rm Mpc^{-1}]}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.25$
\end_inset

.
 This worsens in redshift space to 2% up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.2[h{\rm Mpc^{-1}]}$
\end_inset

.

\color red
 The agreement is, however, improved to XXX% for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<1[h{\rm Mpc^{-1}]}$
\end_inset

 by using the velocity linearly interpolated between the snapshots and the
 true redshift.
 
\color black
Our fiducial choice to construct light cone outputs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.05$
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

.
 The primary goal for those papers was to generate the large numbers of
 simulations required for estimating covariance matrices.
 We quantify, in detail, the impact of size of the time step on large scale
 observables; our suite of simulations are better designed for testing for
 systematic errors in theory and analysis techniques.
 As a proof of principle, we present a set of eight full BOSS (both North
 and South Galactic caps simultaneously) simulations.
 The time savings presented in this paper allowed to extend this to 50 simulatio
ns, across a range of cosmologies
